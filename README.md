# Gene Expression Explorer

An interactive web app for gene expression data analysis and visualization.
Upload your dataset, define sample groups easily, view heatmaps, volcano plots, gene boxplots, and download resultsâ€”all powered by Streamlit and Python.

## Features

- **Universal File Upload:** Supports CSV, TSV, Excel (.xlsx), and compressed (.gz) files.
- **Flexible Group Assignment:** Automatically detects sample groups from column names or allows manual selection/upload of metadata.
- **Advanced Visualizations:** Clustered heatmaps, volcano plots, and gene expression boxplots.
- **Customizable Analysis:** Adjust p-value and log2 fold change thresholds, filter by minimum gene expression.
- **Downloadable Results:** Export analysis summaries and significance flags as CSV.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple data upload, immediate data preview, and easy navigation.

## Example Data Format

| Gene_ID   | Sample1 | Sample2 | ... |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----|
| GENE001   | 12.5    | 8.3     | ... |
| GENE002   | 5.7     | 4.2     | ... |
| ...       | ...     | ...     | ... |

- Genes as rows (first column = gene names/IDs)
- Samples as columns (any naming pattern)
- Expression values should be numeric
- At least two samples per group for statistical analysis

## Installation
